# Timer
Simple timer written in Rust to help me keep track of screen time.

First project to learn rust.
The program is a clock with a timer you set using a slider from 1 second to 7200 seconds (2 hours),
with an additional embedded mp3 file you can choose to go off when the timer ends.
And for added trolling made the program unclickable until the song finishes.

---Planned Features---
Make the program compatible with linux and macos.
Figure out more trolling methods to force users to break their focus and recongize how much time they have spent on the computer.

+++How to install+++
install rustup
cd into directory
cargo build
cd into target\debug
your Timer.exe should be inside folder.
